# GenderGenre
This is the original Python 2.7 code used for analyzing writing samples of
first-year law students and to generate the data for the article
"Gender/Genre: The lack of gendered stylistic differences in texts requiring
genre knowledge," published in Volume xx, Issue yy of the journal _Written
Communication_ (the "Article").

The updated code (written in Python 3.5) used for the article appears in the
repository titled GenderGenreOriginal at
https://github.com/rhetoricked/GenderGenre

This version of the code is intended to support evaluations of the Article
and its methods.

Data collection and preparation, including human coding of key text spans, are
described in the Article and in Larson, B. (2015, May). Gender/Genre: Gender
difference in disciplinary communication (Ph.D. dissertation). University of
Minnesota, Minneapolis. (Dissertation subject to embargo until May 2017.)

The original text artifacts for this study were Microsoft Word files (and one
PDF converted by the researcher to Word). Those files are available from...

The Article points to the following external resources: (1) Online appendices
available at GATech.edu at the specific address identified in the Article;
(2) The corpus of underlying texts (in MS Word format) that are processed here,
to be made available from the Linguistic Data Consortium at the specific
address identified in the Article.
